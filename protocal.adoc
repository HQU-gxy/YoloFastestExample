### shake hand

`0x70` + `deive_id` (which is defined as `{"id": 123, "name": "deive"}`, name is a human-readable label).

id is two byte. return a one dispensible hash key. 4 byte.

From client to server to initiate a connection. Note the UDP port
client using will be reuse until next shake hand. So the client should keep listening
the inital UDP port.
